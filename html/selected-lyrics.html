  <h4>Low In The Laurels</h4>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
          The ground that cradled the nukes was quaking<br>
          And the windows on the rockets breaking<br>
          But the frogs were singing and I was making love.<br><br>
          The farms I knew had become a home<br>
          For the lying, the rich, and the war drones<br>
          But the minnows were swimming and I was grinning.<br><br>
          There’s plastic fruit on the countertops<br>
          No more clementines in the hollow<br>
          Congregations ‘round big money screens<br>
          And I lie low in the laurels.<br><br>
          The teller at the filling station<br>
          Blue bag queen of destinations<br>
          Said your wishes will die, then fossilize, then you’ll pay for them.<br><br>
          My neighbors prayed for gasoline<br>
          Filled up tanks with their dead dreams<br>
          But I was running with the paper bees.<br><br>
          There’s plastic fruit on the countertops<br>
          No more clementines in the hollow<br>
          Congregations ‘round big money screens<br>
          And I lie low in the laurels.<br>
  </p>

  <h4>Honey Upside Down</h4>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
          I’ll learn to turn the honey upside down<br>
          Things that sweet, they take more time and<br>
          I can’t have this now<br>
          So, walk away from it, tell myself<br>
          That it wouldn’t have been ready anyhow<br>
          Things that sweet, they take more time<br>
          To work out.<br><br>
          My neighbor Bertha said<br>
          When she borrowed a sponge<br>
          “Sometimes what’s good needs to<br>
          Sit and get ripe like a plum.<br>
          So, walk away from whatever you can’t change<br>
          It needs to grow with no help from you, hon’.<br>
          Things that good need to<br>
          Sit and get ripe like a plum.”<br><br>
          Walk away from whatever you can’t change<br>
          It needs to grow with no help from you, hon’.<br>
          Things that good need to<br>
          Sit and get ripe like a plum.<br><br>
          Walk away from it, tell myself<br>
          That it wouldn’t have been ready anyhow<br>
          Things that sweet, they take more time and<br>
          I can’t have this now<br>
          Things that sweet, they take more time<br>
          To work out.<br><br>
          I’ll have to turn the honey upside down.<br>
  </p>
