***BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WEBSITE***
This is a website revamp that integrates my yoga and holistic health offerings into my music persona/stage name, Ol Whitetail. Visitors can access my music as well as get information about my yoga classes and coaching services.

***EXPLANATION OF BOOTSTRAP COMPONENTS***
I used the following Bootstrap components:
    1. navbar (all pages)= for the navigation menu to allow toggling on smaller screens
    2. card (index.html) = to create cards on the home page; each card briefly describes different parts of the website
    3. list-group (yoga.html) = to list my offerings and credentials in the categories of yoga and holistic health

***SUMMARY OF JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS***
Here is a summary of each JavaScript function and how I would integrate it in the future:
    **FUNCTION:** document.getElementById('id').onclick=function(){alert('message')}
    *INTEGRATION* display thank you message upon clicking submit
    **FUNCTION:** document.getElementsByClassName('classname').onmouseover(){image.style.filter='hue-rotate(90deg)'}
    *INTEGRATION* change hue of the album cover image on mouseover 
    **FUNCTION:** document.getElementsByClassName('classname').oncontextmenu(){alert("message")}
    *INTEGRATION:* to display copyright notice on right click
    **FUNCTION:** homepage.onload = function(){alert("Welcome!")}
    *INTEGRATION:* to display welcome message when home page loads
